NonlinearEquations.jl: A tool for automatically differentiating systems of nonlinear equations
===============================

Description
-----------

NonlinearEquations.jl is a [Julia](http://julialang.org/) module that includes automatically differentiates systems of nonlinear equations. It is used in the [DPFEHM](https://github.com/OrchardLANL/DPFEHM.jl) subsurface flow simulator.

The [examples](https://github.com/OrchardLANL/NonlinearEquations.jl/tree/master/examples) are a good place to get started to see how to use NonlinearEquations.
